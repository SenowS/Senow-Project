About Shaun Senow
=================

This assignment will be about making a personal page for myself. It will consist of four pages that represent a blog, about me, a contact me page and finally a page that shows the assignments I have made and some screenshots of the code used. The actual code itself will be a project that will continue until I graduate the program. It will start not so great but as time goes on it will look better and better. The changes will be made visible throughout the whole process by using "Git". I will be including scripts in it as well. There won't be too many at the start but as time goes on I will be able to make it run much better as I learn more.
