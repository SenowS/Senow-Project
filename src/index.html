        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to my website! In case we have not met yet, HI! I am Shaun Senow. I am a self proclaimed gamer nerd,
          college student at MITT. I am 25 years old and counting. Some of my hobbies include gaming and watching Twitch
          livestreams. If you would like you know more about me then
          head on over to my about page. It has a cute picture of my dog, so that's pretty cool.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started at MITT in January of 2022 and am currently enrolled in software development. I discovered that I
          enjoyed the writing parts of software development much more than I had originally anticipated. This website is
          going to be a look into my progress on my journey to learn development.
          One of the biggest struggles I have faced while learning Front-End development has for sure been trying to
          learn all of the terms. There are so many to pick up on and this is one thing that I knew would happen, but
          I did not expect there to be as many as there have been. The concepts are all so cool and it constantly amazes
          me just what can be done with a few lines of code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within my site you will find a large variety of content. From something as simple as gaming content to
          something much more advanced like programming. In the future I plan to add much more to this website such as a
          Twitch stream embedded into my site and even Youtube videos that will showcase things that I have made.
          In my blogs the content will be centered around the writing aspects of software development and gaming. Or if
          you are here solely for the programming part of it all,
          feel free to check out the projects page. In there you will find a few of my projects that I have worked on. I
          do plan on adding more in there as time goes on, or even including a catalog of sorts.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you head over to the blog page, you will find some starter information on coding if that would be of
          interest. The content itself is directed more towards begginers, this of course will change over time. But if
          youâ€™re into League content like I am, I have a beginners guide on how to lane as Ahri. I will
          be adding more guides and coding content. If there is something you would like to request to see, then see my
          next statement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or if you would like to contact me, feel free to head over to the contact page and fill out all of your info
          and I will get to you as soon as I can. Or if you would like to reach me quickly, I have included my personal
          contact information as well.
        </p>
