        <p>
          In League of Legends, one of the most impactful things on the game is how one handles the laning phase. This
          could be anything from how you would roam into the enemy team's jungle,
          help out with your own jungle or just help out the other lanes. No champion is more capable of this than Ahri.
          Though some would say she has a weaker laning phase, she more than makes up
          for it with her ability to be mobile and help out throughout the map. Below I will include a picture of the
          runes/spells that you will take in all matchups.
        </p>

        <p>
          For your time spent before being level 6, you may need to answer the question of what should you spend your
          first 500g on? See the chart below for a comparison between potential starts.
        </p>

        <div class="item-chart">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Doran’s Ring + 2 Potions</th>
                <th>Corrupting Potion</th>
                <th>Dark Seal + Refillable Potions</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Pros: Damage + Health + Mana Regeneration</td>
                <td>Pros: 3 Potions that recover Health and Mana. With the addition of a burning effect.</td>
                <td>Pros: Health + Increments on each kill which gives higher damage</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Cons: Not great into higher sustain matchups</td>
                <td>Cons: Lower starting damage</td>
                <td>Cons: If you don’t get kills early. You are at a huge gold disadvantage</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>When to take: Works well into most lanes. When the matchup can be a 50/50 coinflip.</td>
                <td>When to take: Works well when you need a higher sustain in the lane. If the opponent has high
                  sustain or can poke you from far away.</td>
                <td>When to take: If you are confident that you will win against your opponent in skill level. High
                  risk, High reward path.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Champions to take this against: Annie, Diana, Talon, Veigar and Fizz.</td>
                <td>Champions to take this against: Rumble, Pantheon, Orianna, Lux and Ziggs.</td>
                <td>Champions to take this against: Aurelion Sol, Anivia, Ryze, Syndra and Zeri.</td>
              </tr>

        <p>
          Now that you have chosen your starting items the fun starts. Before you are level 6 you will need to play
          safer. So you will want to be sitting just out of range of your opponent but close
          enough that you can poke them with your abilities. At first sight of them rushing at you, you will need to
          back away. But with this safe playstyle it will enable you to watch your map to be
          able to help your team whenever you see the opening. One strong recommendation is always moving to the side
          that your jungler is sitting on, so that they may assist you or you may help them
          as soon as something arises.
        </p>

        <p>
          Abilities in lane are often up for debate by the community. A very consistent and strong order of leveling
          will be included in the picture below:
        </p>

        <div class="ahri-picture">

        </div>

        <p>
          As the lane continues, you will be earning gold from killing the minions or just as time goes. Items play just
          as important of a role, now the order of when to buy items can be situational.
          But a rough idea of what order to build in should be as follows: <br>
          <br>
          1. Everfrost (Your mythical item that slows or roots enemies) <br>
          2. Sorcerer’s Shoes (For the magic penetration and movement speed) <br>
          3. Shadowflame (For extra magic penetration and ability power) <br>
          4. A. Zhonya’s Hourglass (If you need more defensive stats) <br>
          4. B. Rabadon’s Deathcap (If you need higher ability power) <br>
          5. Whichever option you didn’t take from “4” <br>
          6. Void Staff (Significant boost to your magic penetration) This one if needed can be purchased as a 4th item
          but doesn’t carry the priority that the other two have. <br>

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Something that can’t be stressed enough is your vision control!!</strong> There are things called
          “wards” that light up the map for not only you but your team as well.
          The ideal places for these wards are anywhere that are considered “high traffic” areas. The most important
          wards are the red ones, they only cost 75g and are permanent.
          These will only disappear if your opponent can find them and destroy them. By using these wards in an
          effective way, not only will you and your team be safe but it will make it much easier
          to predict your opponent's moves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you make it to level 6, the world opens up to you. Now is when you want to be looking into showing up in
          other peoples lanes to help them out. This is known as roaming
          and it is something Ahri can do quite well. With her ultimate, it makes things much easier for you to just
          chase down your opponent and secure your team kills and just overall pressure.
          Ideally, the bottom lane should be #1 on the list of priorities. Mainly due to the fact that there are two of
          your teammates and two opponents down there.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are the basics to how to survive as Ahri is the laning phase. In the future I will release a more
          advanced guide that will go further into depth about all the different
          strategies or options you can take to further improve at laning.
