        <h2>The world of HTML and CSS</h2>
        <h5>Written by Shaun Senow, March 6th 2022</h5>


        <p>
          In the world of coding there are different languages and ways to code. Here you will be learning about two
          concepts in particular: CSS and HTML. HTML in the shortest terms;
          the content you see on a screen when opening up a website. It consists of multiple smaller things that would
          be: the HTML tag, element, attribute, inline element and the block element.
          In no particular order, examples are provided following each concept. Additionally we have CSS, the background
          side of things that allow your HTML to look presentable. Consisting of:
          the CSS Rule, Selector and Value. These will be in a separate list.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>First, we have the HTML tag. This one is used for anything and everything you want to have. There are many
            tags and plenty of them are straightforward and simple like the
            paragraph tag(p) or the headers which range 1-6 (header#) or even an Image one (img).
          </li>

          <li>Next up, the HTML element. It can go hand in hand with HTML tags, just has the content inside of it.
            Surrounded by an opening and closing tag. Once you type your content
            inside of a paragraph tag for instance, that whole line would now become an element. There are exceptions to
            this such as the break(br) tag, which is an empty element. <br>
            <h5>Ex. < p>This is an element that uses the paragraph tag!< /p></h5>
          </li>

          <li>
            Following with the HTML Attribute. They are the content within the content. For instance, an anchor tag(a)
            would require something in it to determine what it does.
            This would be a link or a destination for that tag to take you to. It can also be descriptive things like:
            the width, height, and the style of it. <br>
            <h5>Ex. < img src=”example.jpg” alt=”Example using IMG tag”></h5>
          </li>

          <li>
            An Inline element would show the content without forcing whatever follows it onto the next line. Allowing
            multiple links in a line without forcing them to move.
            One excellent example of this is anytime you see links at the top of a page in a row, that would be inline.
          </li>

          <li>
            Finally, the Block Element is the opposite of inline. It would occupy the entire line on the screen,
            paragraphs fall heavily into this.
            They take over the entire line on the code line and nothing else can exist alongside it.
          </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Rule: Can be summed up as the elements of the CSS world. It decides the part of your document and what
            happens to it. This consists of: the Selectors, Properties, and Values. <br>
            <h5>Ex. Rule {background color: gray;}</h5>
          </li>

          <li>
            Selectors identify what is changing. This could be anything in the HTML such as, Paragraph tags or the
            Header tags. It decides what the rule applies to. <br>
            <h5>Ex. Rule{} or P{}</h5>

          </li>

          <li>
            Lastly, the Value of the rule. It is the only thing you can visualize from the CSS side of things. Any
            color, font style, or even size comes from having a value.
            These go inside of the rule and within {} brackets to determine the changes made to the Selector. <br>
            <h5>Ex. {background color: gray;}</h5>
          </li>
        </ol>
