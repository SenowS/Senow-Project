        <h2>Keeping it safe with Shaun</h2>
        <h5>Written by Shaun Senow, March 13th 2022</h5>


        <p>
          When it comes to online security, one of the most unfortunate things has to be when your account gets hacked.
          This can come from a variety of reasons, but the primary one has to be
          an unsecured unsecure password. Now most people's passwords are far from secure, this is in part due to either
          their laziness or no creativity. I will be listing a few things that can
          help you secure your passwords. There are many more suggestions but these are the most basic steps to help
          keep up.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Use special characters! When it comes to spelling out a password, opt-in opt in for the special characters
            replacing common letters. E’s become 3’s and S’s become $s.
            It makes the process of guessing your password a whole lot harder.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>DON’T USE THE SAME PASSWORD!!</strong> I can’t stress this one enough. One password for every
            website will for sure lead to your account being hacked into. All it takes is one site
            to be compromised in any way, then the hackers will have all they need to get into everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change your passwords every 3-6 months. Having your passwords constantly rotating or evolving, will further
            reduce the chances of being hacked. If you want to take it a step further
            you can change them every month.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using words that are easily predictable. Everyone loves their pets and children, but using their names
            in your password makes things that much easier to figure out.
            Same with your birthday or anniversary years. If you insist on using words in your passwords, I would highly
            recommend picking random words that have no relation to yourself.
            Even with the numbers, you may throw into there. Using a random number generator will yield far stronger
            results.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Keeping up to date with your passwords is a very important thing to do. At times it can be annoying to have to
          remember so many but the cons of not changing them far outweigh outweighs
          the pros. One small slip in your passwords could result in someone getting access to something very important.
          In one of the worst-case worst case scenarios, it could be your bank info.
          I don’t need to explain how bad that could be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trying to keep up to date could be a challenge but there are options out there. You could go with the classic
          sticky note play but something that would be much better would be a
          password manager. They are one of the safest ways to store and use your passwords, obviously, they aren’t 100%
          foolproof fool proof but they most certainly work. Many managers use
          layer after layer of security to keep things safe and locked in. Very rarely do you ever hear of one being
          compromised?.
