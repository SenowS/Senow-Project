        <h2>Beginners Guide to Don't Starve</h2>
        <h5>Written by Shaun Senow, April 14th 2022</h5>

        <p>
          One of the most challenging games has to be Don’t Starve. Now if you agree with that statement and want to
          learn how to start out, you have come to the right place! In a game where everything is out to kill you and it
          most certainly finds a way to do just that. In this short and simple guide, I will be explaining how a first
          year should go which is a great start to being able to survive in this harsh world.
        </p>

        <div class="test">
          <h3>Days 1 - 6: </h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to your first few days, you are mainly just going to be collecting grass and sticks.
            <strong>LOTS OF
              THEM!!</strong> Use these to make basic tools such as the pickaxe, torch and axe. While collecting, try
            and take note of any beefalos you may find and ultimately you want to be
            searching for the pig village. A side bonus would be finding the chester or clockwork creatures. When it
            becomes dark, stick to using just a torch to make it through the night. If they are around the area, try and
            mine the rocks that show up which have a gold vein in them.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="test">
          <h3>Days 7 - 14: </h3>
          <p>
            Now that you have collected as many basic resources that you can find, it is time to set up your camp. Try
            and
            avoid things that will be hostile to you. This being swamps, ponds or anywhere that there are spiders. Some
            basic things to build in this base is of course a firepit for the long nights, a science machine so that you
            may have access to better tools and an alchemy engine to further improve on your tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            After these necessary things have been set up, you are going to want to look towards food production. Making
            many farming plots is essential to being able to survive with how diverse they are. On top of these, it’s
            safe
            to assume that you may need to build some crock-pots to cook those vegetables and meat. Finally to top off
            your food area, it’s going to need some drying racks. Drying meat not only makes them last longer, but also
            offers some quick health on the go.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="test">
          <h3>Days 15 - Winter: </h3>
          <p>
            If you have made it this far without too many problems, consider yourself lucky. But unfortunately things
            will
            only get harder. At this point you’ve probably realized that food spoils quicker than one might expect.
            Simple
            solution to this is turning to the refrigerator. During the first few days while exploring, you may have
            come
            across the clockwork creatures. Now is the time to go and kill them, so you are going to want to make some
            log
            suits to use as armor and spear. Once these are dead, it’s time to make an icebox which is used to store
            your
            food to preserve it.
          </p>

          <p>
            From this point until winter comes, just start stocking up on everything food and resource related. If there
            is some extra time to kill, one great option is to go out and try to find some spiders to kill for some silk
            and monster meat. While searching for these, if you can find a hut area, it will have the walrus guy show up
            in winter. By killing him you may be able to get his tools that will greatly improve your life.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="test">
          <h3>Winter: </h3>
          <p>
            With winter now upon you, there is not a whole lot more to say. Something that is crucial to making it
            through
            is using the food that you have stored as well as making a heat stone to keep you warm and not freeze to
            death. If the option is there, try and make a winter hat to further ensure that you do not succumb to the
            cold.
          </p>

          <p>
            The only real thing to do in the winter aside from trying not to freeze or starve is trying to kill that
            walrus which was previously mentioned. Using a boomerang is your best bet to kill him or if they are around
            and you can afford it, feed the pigs that are around your pig village. If they die while fighting you can
            cook
            them and eat them, so really it’s a win win.

          There you have it! With this guide, you are all set to survive your first year in Don’t Starve. The following
          years will get much harder, but you are on the right track. Check back in the future for another guide on how
          to make it through the following years and maybe even how to survive in the underground.
